## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Junior Full-Stack Developer** with a passion for writing clean, modern code that makes users' lives easier. After graduating from the Northcoders JavaScript bootcamp, I’ve delivered polished freelance projects, including **Eventico**, a professional-grade event platform.

Currently levelling up in **TypeScript** and **Python**, and always exploring smarter ways to build fast, scalable apps.
